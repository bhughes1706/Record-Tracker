# Record-Tracker
**IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT**

tracks record collection and value fluctuations

The idea behind this program was to add features to Discogs, by automatically downloading someone's library and then providing a feature to add the price they paid for the record. This will provide a 'stock market' like feature to Discogs that is currently missing. This is a side project and may have periodic bursts of activity and then sit for some time.

Initially, the data will be pulled from the .csv file you may request from the Discogs website. Once this is working, I'll begin an attempt to work with Discogs to directly pull the user information from their website (I doubt this will happen, but it'd be way easier for the user)

Export-> Collection -> Request Data Export -> wait for the .csv file.

This is an OOP design, which provides tracking between typical records, boxsets, 7", or 78 rpm, so you can see what is going up in value and what you should probably stop spending money on.

This is partly an academic experience, and partly because records are fun.
