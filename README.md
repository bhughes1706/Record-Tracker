# Record-Tracker

tracks record collection and value fluctuations

The idea behind this program was to add features to Discogs, by automatically downloading someone's library and then providing a feature to add the price they paid for the record. This will provide a 'stock market' like feature to Discogs that is currently missing. This is a side project and may have periodic bursts of activity and then sit for some time. Don't hold it against me, I can only do so much :)

This is an OOP design, which provides tracking between typical records, boxsets, 7", or 78 rpm, so you can see what is going up in value and what you should probably stop spending money on.
